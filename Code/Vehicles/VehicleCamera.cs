/// late - more so in a slide, where it looks the way the car's going. It hangs back as the car accelerates and closes
/// in under braking, the field of view opens up with speed and boost, it shakes a little when it's going fast, and it
/// settles after jumps. The mouse orbits it and it stays where you put it, until you've been driving a while without
/// touching the mouse - then it eases back behind the car.
