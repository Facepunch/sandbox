Sandbox for S&Box but with a bad camera tool, plus a few others.

Short overview:
* Camera Tool: Spawn and control a Camera.
* Color Changer: Change the color of props in a predicable way (also allows for transparent props).
* Disable Collision: Disable Collision on props.
* Hotdog Balloon: Balloons, but Hotdogs.
* Weld 2: A very bad weld tool that allows welding ragdolls (does not work very well).

Some custom cmd for helping controlling the camera:
physgun_toggleefx - Toggle the Physgun grabbing effects on props/ragdolls.

* cam_togglehud - Toggles the HUD when viewing from the camera tool.
* cam_setfov - Set the fov of the camera tool.
  * Usage: cam_setfov <number>
  * Example: cam_setfov 90
* player_hide and player_show - Hides or shows the player.
 
 You can bind keys to those commands in the console like this:  
 bind F8 physgun_toggleefx
